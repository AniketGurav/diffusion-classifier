<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Abstract

The recent wave of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has dramatically increased our text-based image generation abilities. These models can generate realistic images for a staggering variety of prompts and exhibit impressive compositional generalization abilities. Almost all use cases thus far have solely focused on sampling; however, diffusion models can also provide conditional density estimates, which are useful for tasks beyond image generation.

In this paper, we show that the density estimates from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be leveraged to perform zero-shot classification *without any additional training*. Our generative approach to classification, which we call **Diffusion Classifier**, attains strong results on a variety of benchmarks and outperforms alternative methods of extracting knowledge from diffusion models. We also find that our diffusion-based approach has stronger multimodal relational reasoning abilities than competing contrastive approaches.

Finally, we use Diffusion Classifier to extract standard classifiers from class-conditional diffusion models trained on ImageNet. Even though these diffusion models are trained with weak augmentations and no regularization, we find that they approach the performance of SOTA discriminative ImageNet classifiers. Overall, our strong generalization and robustness results represent an encouraging step toward using generative over discriminative models for downstream tasks.
